# BBM406-Project-Moodify
Course project for BBM406 - Moodify.

Work in progress!

## Installation
Download Multi-modal MIREX-like emotion dataset (2013) from http://mir.dei.uc.pt/downloads.html

Extract the Audio and Lyrics files and split them into subfolders using the .bat files in the zip.

Make sure that the files are splitted as: Audio/Cluster (Count)/(Class Name)

After the splitting is done, run CreateDataset.py to extract the audio dataset as .json files.
